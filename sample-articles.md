Implement strategic code splitting to reduce initial bundle size:

```javascript
const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <LazyComponent />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

### Memoization
Use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback strategically:

```javascript
const ExpensiveComponent = React.memo(({ data }) => {
  const processedData = useMemo(() => {
    return data.map(item => expensiveOperation(item));
  }, [data]);

  return <div>{processedData}</div>;
});
```

## TypeScript Integration

TypeScript is essential for scalable React applications:

- Provides compile-time error checking
- Improves developer experience with better IDE support

Validate all user input:

```javascript
// Server-side validation example
const validateEmail = (email) => {
  const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  return emailRegex.test(email) && email.length <= 254;
};
```

### SQL Injection Prevention
Use parameterized queries and ORM tools:

```sql
-- Bad: Vulnerable to SQL injection
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '${userEmail}';

-- Good: Parameterized query
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = $1;
```

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention

### Content Security Policy
Implement a strict CSP header:

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
```

### Output Encoding
Always encode user-generated content before displaying it in the browser.

## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection

Implement CSRF tokens for state-changing operations:

```javascript
// Include CSRF token in forms
<input type="hidden" name="_token" value={csrfToken} />
```

## Security Headers

Implement essential security headers:

```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
```

## Regular Security Audits

### Dependency Scanning
Regularly scan for vulnerable dependencies:

```bash
npm audit
npm audit fix
```

### Penetration Testing
Conduct regular security assessments:
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Manual penetration testing
- Code security reviews

## Incident Response

Prepare for security incidents:

1. **Detection:** Implement monitoring and alerting
2. **Response:** Have a clear incident response plan
3. **Recovery:** Procedures for system restoration
4. **Lessons Learned:** Post-incident analysis and improvements

## Conclusion

Web application security is an ongoing process, not a one-time implementation. Stay updated with the latest security threats, regularly audit your applications, and always prioritize security in your development process.

Remember: Security is everyone's responsibility, not just the security team's.
